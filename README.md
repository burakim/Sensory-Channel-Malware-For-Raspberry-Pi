# Sensory-Channel-Malware-For-Raspberry-Pi

## What does it do?
It runs with a photoresistor that is connected to Raspberry Pi from GPIO4 pin. 

Whenever it received the light "ON,OFF,ON,OFF" pattern, it suddenly shuts down the target Raspberry Pi. 

It should be runned as a systems service under "/etc/systemd" folder in the Raspberry Pi.

## How can I install it to my system as a system service?

### Step 1:

You should create a file whose name is "virus.service" under "/etc/systemd/system" folder. Then, you should fill the following service information into the service file.

```
[Unit]
Description= virus

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Allias=virus.service

[Service]
ExecStart /usr/bin/python /home/pi/Desktop/light_malware.py
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SysLogIdentifier=IMS
```
### Step 2:

After creating the light malware service file, you should enter following commands to the Raspberry Pi terminal.

```
sudo systemctl enable virus.service
sudo systemctl start virus.service
```

## How to remove the malware from your system

```
sudo systemctl stop virus.service
sudo systemctl disable virus.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/virus.service
```
